This is a broad statement, but it's the culmination of being forever inspired by Isaac Asimov’s “Foundation” novel series. In this alternative future, a scientist develops a branch of mathematics, called psychohistory, which predicts the future of a civilization with mathematical certainty. The closest thing we have to the field of psychohistory is an interdisciplinary branch of science called <strong>Data Science</strong>. Data Science has been pushed into the limelight because we have only recently been exposed to big data. We live in a world where most of our behavior is recorded and we use big data to <em>predict</em> what will happen when we are exposed to certain conditions. </p>
<p>How do we answer meaningful questions? We answer these questions through studying <strong>cause and effect</strong>, in a science which we call <strong>Causal Inference</strong>. The aim of many researchers from multiple disciplines including, but certainly not limited to, Computer Science, Economics, Politics and Marketing is to develop methods that will help us accurately estimate causal effects. The problem, however, is that many scientific disciplines developed different methods and work in silos. My wish is that Causal Inference be a branch on its own and that researchers from any discipline choose the causal inference method that is best suited for the problem, regardless where it originated. </p>
<p>In my research, I aim to develop methods that provide a universal language of causal inference, by using causal diagrams and machine learning, based on a conceptual understanding of how data is interlinked. The goal is to develop methods that will help us understand patterns of complex social science phenomena, and to increase the rigor and transparency of research methods used in social science. I have published in journals such as <em>Organizational Research Methods</em> (forthcoming) and <em>Journal of Causal Inference</em>.</p>

<p><em><strong>“The advancement of our civilization has mostly been enabled by partnerships that were formed throughout history. Great movements and occurrences are usually known and symbolized by a single group or person but what is often overlooked is that strong leaders are craftsmen in influencing people around them”</strong></em> - Opening lines of my Masters thesis in 2018 </p>
<p>So the question is, how do we mathematically model how organizations make decisions? In my postdoctoral research, I am developing a multi-decision-making model that guides the process in which organizations, which consists out of many individuals, make decisions. I am working in collaboration with eight firms as they are transitioning towards a new sustainable technology.</p>
